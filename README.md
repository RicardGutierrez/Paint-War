# Paint-War
Our project is a 1vs1 game, where the player controls a circle that is painting the screen with his trail. The goal is to paint more than you adversary in a limited amount of time.

## How it works 

The program is divided into 3 sections, which are the different screens:

<ol>
<li> The initial: there is only the title of the game and pressing any button already
you go in to play.</li>
<li> The game: two players in the form of circles, are painting the screen to measure
which are moving with a time limit. Calculating the pixels of
each color creates a score that is the percentage of the screen
painted. Punctuation and timer data are displayed at the bottom.</li>
<li> The final: the winner is shown and in case of pressing any button
back to the game.</li>
  </ol>
